I am a PhD student at UT Austin. 
I work with Professor [Loukas Kallivokas](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/kallivokas/) and I am a part of the [MUSE Lab](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/muse/) in the [Department of Civil Engineering](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/) at UT Austin.
Concurrently, I am also pursuing Master's in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics in the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/) with Professors [Loukas Kallivokas](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/kallivokas/) and [Omar Ghattas](https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~omar/) at UT Austin.

Previously, I worked with Professor [Subhadeep Banerjee](https://home.iitm.ac.in/subhadeep/index.htm) for my M.Tech project on the analysis of liquefaction, where I conducted several cyclic triaxial tests and later performed numerical analysis. 
Shortly afterwards, I worked with Professor [Saravanan Umakanthan](https://civil.iitm.ac.in/faculty/saran/) in the department of structural engineering on the topic of Numerical Technique to solve boundary value problems, where I assisted with the conversion of MATLAB code to C++ code for the purpose of parallelizing the FEM computations for a 2D truss problem.
In my undergraduate I worked on two projects on developing flow duration curves of Krishna basin and in calculating extreme climate indices of Kaveri Basin using Mann-Kendall and Sen-slope analysis under the supervision of Professor [Lakshman Nandagiri](https://appmech.nitk.ac.in/faculty/lakshman-nandagiri).
